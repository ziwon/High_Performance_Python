    "\n",
    "- IPC (Instruction Per Cycle): The number of operations it can done in one cycle (ex. vectorization, SIMD - single instruction, multiple data)\n",
    "- Clock Speed: How many cycles it can do in one second\n",
    "- Hyperthreading: A virtual second CPU to the host OS\n",
    " - Interleave two threads of instructions into the execution units on a single CPU (ex. floating-point operations and integer operations)\n",
    "- Out-of-order execution: Not depend on the previous results (ex. waiting for a memory access)\n",
    "- Multicore architecture\n",
    " - Amdahl's law: Some routines that must run on one core will be the bottleneck for the final speedup of adding more cores.\n",
    " - GIL (Global Interpreter Lock, one instruction at a time) in Python is a major hurdle with utilizing multiple cores\n",
    "  - Even with 100 question askers, only one could ask a question at a time\n",
    "  - Can be avoided by `multiprocessing`, `numexpr`, `Cython` or distributed computing \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Memory Units\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used to store bits: variables, the pixels of an image\n",
    "- The read/write speed is depend on the way the data is being read\n",
    "- *Sequential Read* is much better than *Random Data*\n",
    "- Latency is big on the hard drive and is small on RAM\n",
    "- The types of various memory units: Spinning hard drive, Solid stae hard drive, RAM, L1/L2 cache\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communications Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- frontside bus: between RAM and the L1/L2 cache\n",
    "- backside bus: from cache to CPU \n",
    "- external bus: the routes from hardware devices to the CPU and system memory\n",
    "- GPU as a peripheral device communiates through the PCI bus.\n",
    "- the network is limited than the frontside bus which transfers gigabits per second\n",
    "- **bus width**: how much data can be moved in one transfer\n",
    "- **bud frequencey**: how many transfer it can do per second"
